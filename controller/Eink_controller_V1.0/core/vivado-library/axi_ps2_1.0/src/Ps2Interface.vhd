-- Purpose:
-- This module is responsible for implementing the PS/2 protocol (as host). 
-- At its core there is a FSM which, depending on its inputs, performs the 
-- necessary PS/2 transactions, either for transmitting or receiving data. Data
-- is also serialized or deserialized inside the FSM, the parity is checked, and 
-- its validity is established. It also governs auxiliary processes such as the 
-- delays needed to meet PS/2 specific timming. If any errors have occured they 
-- will be signaled using either err_par or err_nack.

-- This file contains the implementation of a generic bidirectional
-- ps/2 interface.

--  Behavioral description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Please read the following article on the web for understanding how
-- the ps/2 protocol works.
-- http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2protocol/

-- This module implements a generic bidirectional ps/2 interface. It can
-- be used with any ps/2 compatible device. It offers its clients a
-- convenient way to exchange data with the device. The interface
-- transparently wraps the byte to be sent into a ps/2 frame, generates
-- parity for byte and sends the frame one bit at a time to the device.
-- Similarly, when receiving data from the ps2 device, the interface
-- receives the frame, checks for parity, and extract the usefull data
-- and forwards it to the client. If an error occurs during receiving
-- or sending a byte, the client is informed by settings the err output
-- line high. This way, the client can resend the data or can issue
-- a resend command to the device.

-- The physical ps/2 interface uses 4 lines
-- For the 6-pin connector pins are assigned as follows: 
-- 1 - Data
-- 2 - Not Implemented
-- 3 - Ground
-- 4 - Vcc (+5V)
-- 5 - Clock
-- 6 - Not Implemented

-- The clock line carries the device generated clock which has a 
-- frequency in range 10 - 16.7 kHz (30 to 50us). When line is idle
-- it is placed in high impedance. The clock is only generated when
-- device is sending or receiving data.
-- The Data and Clock lines are both open-collector with pullup
-- resistors to Vcc. An "open-collector" interface has two possible
-- states: low('0') or high impedance('Z').

-- When device wants to send a byte, it pulls the clock line low and the
-- host(i.e. this interfaces) recognizes that the device is sending data
-- When the host wants to send data, it makes a request to send. This
-- is done by holding the clock line low for at least 100us, then with
-- the clock line low, the data line is brought low. Next the clock line
-- is released (placed in high impedance). The devices begins generating
-- clock signal on clock line.
-- When receiving data, bits are read from the data line (ps2_data) on
-- the falling edge of the clock (ps2_clk). When sending data, the
-- device reads the bits from the data line on the rising edge of the
-- clock.
-- A frame for sending a byte is comprised of 11 bits as shown bellow:
-- bits     10     9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1      0
--        -------------------------------------------------------------
--        | STOP| PAR | D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 | START |
--        -------------------------------------------------------------
-- STOP  - stop  bit, always '1'
-- PAR   - parity bit, odd parity for the 8 data bits.
--       - select in such way that the number of bits of '1' in the data
--       - bits together with parity bit is odd.
-- D0-7  - data bits.
-- START - start bit, always '0'
--
-- Frame is sent bit by bit starting with the least significant bit
-- (starting bit) and is received the same way. This is done, when
-- receiving, by shifting the frame register to the left when a bit
-- is available and placing the bit on data line on the most significant
-- bit. This way the first bit sent will reach the least significant bit
-- of the frame when all the bits have been received. When sending data
-- the least significant bit of the frame is placed on the data line
-- and the frame is shifted to the right when another bit needs to be
-- sent. During the request to send, when releasing the clock line,
-- the device reads the data line and interprets the data on it as the
-- first bit of the frame. Data line is low at that time, at this is the
-- way the start bit('0') is sent. Because of this, when sending, only
-- 10 shifts of the frame will be made.
-- While the interface is sending or receiving data, the busy output
-- signal goes high. When interface is idle, busy is low.
-- After sending all the bits in the frame, the device must acknowledge
-- the data sent. This is done by the host releasing and data line
-- (clock line is already released) after the last bit is sent. The
-- devices brings the data line and the clock line low, in this order,
-- to acknowledge the data. If data line is high when clock line goes
-- low after last bit, the device did not acknowledge the data and
-- err output is set.
-- A FSM is used to manage the transitions the set all the command
-- signals. States that begin with "rx_" are used to receive data
-- from device and states begining with "tx_" are used to send data
-- to the device.
-- For the parity bit, a ROM holds the parity bit for all possible
-- data (256 possible values, since 8 bits of data). The ROM has
-- dimensions 256x1bit. For obtaining the parity bit of a value,
-- the bit at the data value address is read. Ex: to find the parity
-- bit of 174, the bit at address 174 is read.
-- For generating the necessary delay, counters are used. For example,
-- to generate the 100us delay a 14 bit counter is used that has the
-- upper limit for counting 10000. The interface is designed to run
-- at 100MHz. Thus, 10000x10ns = 100us.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- If using the interface at different frequency than 100MHz, adjusting
-- the delay counters is necessary!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Clock line(ps2_clk) and data line(ps2_data) are passed through a
-- debouncer for the transitions of the clock and data to be clean.
-- Also, ps2_clk_s and ps2_data_s hold the debounced and synchronized
-- value of the clock and data line to the system clock(clk).
