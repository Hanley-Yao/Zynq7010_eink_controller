						<h1>HTTP Server Demo</h1>

						<br><br>

						This sketch is an example of an HTTP server built with the chipKIT MPIDE using the
						Digilent Network Libraries. It demostrates the use of a Web browser as the
						interface to monitor and control an embedded application running on a Digilent
						chipKIT board or on a Digilent Cerebot board.

						<br><br>

						This demonstration illustrates the use of program code to generate HTML in
						response to requests from a browser. It also illustrates using a file system on an
						SD card that contains HTML files and images that can also be used in response to a
						browser.

						<br><br>

						When processing an HTTP <code>Get</code> request message, the HTTP server code
						will first determine if the resource being requested is a hard-coded resource. If
						so, it will call the appropriate function to generate the HTML for the
						response. If the requested resource isn't one of the hard-coded resources, the
						server will look on the SD card for a file containing the requested resource.

						<br><br>

						The standard chipKIT SD library is used to access the file system on the SD card.
						The MPIDE SD card library provides the ability to accesss files contained in a FAT
						file system on the SD card. The library doesn't support long file names, so
						only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename" target="blank">8.3 file
						names</a> can be used, i.e., the name consists of a maximum of eight characters, a
						period, and then an &ldquo;extension&rdquo; that has a maximum of three
						characters.

						<br><br>

						The HTTP server currently supports the following data types in its responses:
						plain text, HTML format text, JPEG format images, and PNG format images.  It also
						supports the use of HTML forms. HTML forms can be used to control the operation of
						the embedded application being hosted by the microcontroller board.
