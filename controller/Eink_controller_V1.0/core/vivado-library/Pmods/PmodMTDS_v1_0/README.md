PmodMTDS IP
============

Using the IP in Vivado
------------
A tutorial for using Pmod IP cores in  Vivado is available [here](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/pmod-ips/start).
Interrupts are not necessary for the demo programs to work. Do not rename the
PmodMTDS IP in the block design in Vivado, changing the IP's name from the
default (PmodMTDS_0) will cause the software drivers to fail.

Demo Program in Xilinx SDK
------------
For information on the demo programs for the PmodMTDS, see the README file in
the directory drivers/PmodMTDS_v1_0/examples.
